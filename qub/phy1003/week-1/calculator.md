# Using Python as a basic calculator

## The Spyder IDE

### Opening the Spyder application

In this course, we're going to use the *'Spyder'* application which is especially useful for scientific programming.  Spyder is an acronym (sort of!) for '**S**cientific **PY**thon **D**evelopment **E**nvi**R**onment'.

To open this program, click the *'Search Windows'* icon on the bottom-left corner of your desktop, type *'Spyder'* and left-click the *'Spyder'* icon that appears. The application may take a few moments to open.

When the application is opened, have a look around the main window and you'll see that it consists of a variety of *'panes'*. The default layout is shown below. 

The two most important panes at this stage are the *'console'* (on the bottom-right) and the *'editor'* (on the left). 

* The **console** allows you to input Python commands one at a time and, if applicable, shows you the results immediately. The console is most useful when learning new concepts and trying out different ideas.  We will start off by using the console.
* The **editor** is used for grouping multiple Python commands together into programs. This acts similarly to text editors such as Notepad, in that you can type your code, save the file (which will have a .py extension) and make edits when required. When you run the .py file, the lines of code will be executed sequentially. Note that the results of calculations performed here will not be immediately shown in the console (but can be outputted using the print() function discussed later).
